      <h2>About Anakin Skywalker And Where He is From Based On The Facts</h2>
      <p>Anakin Skywalker was one of the most powerful Jedi who ever lived. Raised as a slave on the desert planet Tatooine, 
	  he was discovered as a young boy and trained as a Jedi by Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
	  Fear and pride drove him to the dark side of the Force, 
	  and, as Darth Vader, he helped slaughter nearly all the Jedi in the galaxy. </p>
