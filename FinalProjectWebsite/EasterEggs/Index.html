<p> Easter is a holiday commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter is viewed as the origin of Christianity and as the religion's biggest holiday. <span style="color: #01B18E">The Easter Bunny and eggs are common symbols for the holidays as well, but they have religious roots.</span> The Easter bunny is a much-celebrated character in American Easter celebrations. On Easter Sunday, children look for hidden special treats, often chocolate Easter eggs, that the Easter bunny might have left behind. </p>
